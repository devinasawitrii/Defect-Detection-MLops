# Steel Surface Defect Detection: YOLO26 + MLOps

End-to-end computer vision project: fine-tune **YOLO26** to **detect and localise 6 types of hot-rolled steel
surface defects** (NEU-DET), then ship it the way a production team would: reproducible pipeline, experiment
tracking, tested code, containerised API, CI/CD, and drift monitoring.

> **Live demo:** _add your Hugging Face Space link here_ &nbsp;|&nbsp; **API image:** `ghcr.io/<you>/defect-detection-mlops/defect-api`

## Why this project

Manual visual inspection on a steel line is slow and inconsistent. A detector that says *what* defect is present
and *where* lets the line react early (and handles strips with several defects). The model is intentionally the
smaller half of this repo; the point is the full lifecycle around it.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/defect-detection-mlops && cd defect-detection-mlops
make install

# 1. Put NEU-DET (images + .xml annotations) under data/raw/  (see notebooks/colab_train.ipynb)
make data          # VOC -> YOLO format, train/val/test split
make train         # fine-tune YOLO26, logs to MLflow
make evaluate      # metrics/eval.json (mAP) + plots
make export        # models/model.onnx (+ parity check)
make visualize     # reports/predictions_grid.png
make reference     # drift reference stats
make examples      # sample images for the demo

make mlflow-ui     # http://localhost:5000
make serve         # http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Call the API

```bash
curl -F "file=@examples/scratches.jpg" "http://localhost:8000/predict?conf=0.25"
curl -F "file=@examples/scratches.jpg" http://localhost:8000/predict/image -o annotated.png
```

```json
{"detections": [{"label": "scratches", "confidence": 0.91, "box": [12.0, 40.5, 118.2, 96.0]}],
 "n_detections": 1, "image_size": [200, 200], "latency_ms": 38.2}
```

### Docker

```bash
make docker-build && make docker-run
```

### Drift monitoring demo

```bash
make drift-demo
```

Logs 200 normal predictions (monitor says `ok`), then 200 with simulated lighting change + sensor noise
(monitor reports `drift` and exits non-zero, so it can gate a scheduled job or trigger retraining).

### Reproduce the whole pipeline

```bash
dvc repro
```

## Tests

```bash
make test
```

The suite generates a synthetic NEU-DET-style dataset (images + VOC XML) and exercises the real path end to end:
VOC conversion → train a tiny YOLO26 → evaluate → ONNX export → API → drift detection. It also asserts that the
serving letterbox is **pixel-identical** to the one Ultralytics applies at train time, a classic source of silent
train/serve skew.

## Design decisions & trade-offs

- **Detection, not just classification.** Real lines have several defects per strip and care where they are.
  YOLO is still a CNN under the hood, and it is fine-tuned from COCO weights (transfer learning).
- **NMS-free head, used consistently.** YOLO26 can export a head whose outputs are already final detections.
  Training-time model selection, evaluation, parity checks and export all use that same head (`nms=False`), so the
  reported mAP describes the model that is actually deployed. The export stage also re-evaluates the ONNX file on
  the test split and fails if its mAP@50 drifts more than 0.02 from PyTorch (`metrics/export.json`).
- **ONNX Runtime for serving.** The API image doesn't ship PyTorch or Ultralytics, so it stays small. The
  export step fails the build if ONNX and PyTorch outputs disagree.
- **Train/serve preprocessing parity.** The serving letterbox reimplements Ultralytics' (OpenCV bilinear, grey 114
  padding, same rounding) and is tested pixel-for-pixel. An earlier PIL-based resize differed enough to change
  detection counts.
- **De-duplication before splitting.** Mirrors of this dataset contain repeated files; leaving them in inflates test scores.
- **Drift on cheap statistics.** Brightness, contrast, detections per image and top confidence need no labels, so
  they work in production where ground truth arrives late (if at all).

## Limitations & next steps

- NEU-DET images are clean, uniform, 200×200 grayscale. Real lines have lighting changes, motion blur and new
  defect types; expect a domain gap and plan for fine-tuning on plant data.
- Heavily overlapping or very large defects (e.g. patches, rolled-in scale) are harder to box consistently.
- The gate threshold (mAP@50 ≥ 0.65) is a starting point; set it from your own baseline.
- Automate retraining when the drift monitor fires; promote models through the MLflow Model Registry.

## Dataset, license & credits

NEU-DET (Northeastern University, China): 1,800 grayscale images, 6 defect classes (crazing, inclusion, patches,
pitted surface, rolled-in scale, scratches) with bounding-box annotations. Please cite the original authors
(K. Song and Y. Yan, 2013) if you publish results, and check the dataset's license before redistributing images.

The training code uses [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), licensed **AGPL-3.0**. That
is fine for an open-source portfolio project, but a closed-source commercial deployment would need an Ultralytics
enterprise license (or a different detector).
